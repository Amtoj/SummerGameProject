To whom it conserns,

I appologize for the sudden burst of organization. 
However this was a necisary step along development 
that hopes to make future development of the game 
easier.

I need who ever is working on VFX to sort through all 
the files contained in this folder and seperate them 
accordinly to the new file arangment.

i.e. Shader scripts in the Shaders folder, Materials 
in the Materials folder, and Textures in the Textures
folder.

If someone needs one spesific material, they should not 
need to search inside of the artspecific/animations/VFX 
folder. 

Again. I am sorry for this inconvenience and hope to see
the organization of this project sorted soon.

- Sincerely, Daniel
